# CogBot Analytics

R code for simple analytics for the cogpsybot line. This includes @cogpsybot, @cogagingbot, and @quantpsybot.

The code pulls from each of the associated Twitter accounts and analyzes all tweets for the content of the article titles. These words are then analyzed for their frequency and then submitted to a program that creates a word cloud of the results.

The CogBots are a series of Twitterbots dedicated to mining journal websites related to Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Aging, and Quantitative Psychology.
